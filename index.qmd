## About me

I am passionate about using my data and analytical science skills
to process and analyse large datasets.

I successfully defended my PhD thesis in December last year (2022) and I am now working for a Fintech start-up

The focus of my PhD research was the study of base oils
and other complex mixtures by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR)
mass spectrometry (MS).

In addition to my research, I developed both new R
routines and applications ([see some here](projects.qmd)), to support both my own and colleagues research
activities, as well as the maintenance and continual development of critical
software tools used by the wider research group.
